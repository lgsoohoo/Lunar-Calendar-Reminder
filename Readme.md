# Lunar Calendar Reminder

## What is this?

Trying to remember a specific yearly Lunar Calendar event can be a pain, since a Lunar Calendar date isn't always on the same day in the Gregorian Calendar. For example, if you wanted to remember a friend or family member's Lunar Calendar birthday, you have to look it up every single year, which can be a pain. An alternative would be to add the entire Lunar Calendar to your digital calendar, but that is way more information than you might need and your calendar still won't remind you about your event.

"Lunar Calendar Reminder" solves this problem by calculating the Gregorian equivalents for your Lunar Calendar event, and generating a custom CSV or iCal calendar that can be imported into your Google Calendar (or any program that can import a CSV or iCal file). Once imported, you can use your calendar program to set reminders for the event!

## How do I use this?
1. Go to the [Lunar Calendar Reminder website](https://lgsoohoo.github.io/Lunar-Calendar-Reminder/) and fill in the information about your event
2. Choose either the "CSV" (Google Calendar/MS Outlook) or "iCal" file format
3. Click "Generate" and save the file on your computer
4. Import the file onto your digital calendar using one of the following methods:

##### To import into Google Calendar:
1. Open Google Calendar and open the Settings menu by clicking on the gear icon in the upper left
2. Select "Import & Export" from the menu on the right
3. Under the "Import" header, click on "Select file from your computer," and navigate to the file you downloaded
4. Choose which calendar to import the events into by using the "Add to calendar" drop-down menu
5. Press "Import"

##### To import into MS Outlook (Web):
1. On the left side, select "Add calendar". If you do not see it, press the "hamburger menu button" next to the "New event" button
2. Click on "Upload from file" from the screen that appears
3. Drag your downloaded file or use the "Browse" button
4. Select which calendar to import to using the drop-down menu and press "Import"
